# visualising-graphs
a helper webpage for visualising graphs in lad format as well as the format used when running the auto-graph-generator tool in [Glasgow-Subgraph-Solver](https://github.com/ciaranm/glasgow-subgraph-solver). Can be extended to include more format and will auto detect for the two previously mentioned - there is not a good software practise inplace for plugging new formats in easily, infact, I have a monolith .tsx file doing all the work at the moment (real bad)!

# getting-started
there is a readme inside the folder **my-app** that is the default template for next.js apps, use this. I will attempt a quick start guide.

  1. Go [here](https://visgraph.mrktrnbll.dev/) for a real quick setup!
---
  1. move into my-app folder ```cd my-app```
  2. install dependecies ```npm install```
  3. start react app in dev mode ```npm run dev```
  4. open browser and go to ```http://localhost:3000```

# building project
this is done automatically and I will assume no will want to do this... if you do look at next.js documentation, it's great and will have done a better job documenting that me.
